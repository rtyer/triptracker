focus on the route start/end
no map on phone while driving
	avg speed, distance remaining, eta would be nicer

focus on peer aspect
	see times from other places similar to your start/stop at this time and show the route (with directions?????)
	
have nice web interface to show your routes, etc

no account necessary to browse routes/times

also show times via bus, etc?
